Tool evaluation and experimentation area

## Positives

* Thresholds are really good, the grown up way to talk about load testing.
* An excellent way to begin the SLO implementation, with something you can show codified early

## Negatives

* Yet to see how you would do peak type scenarios
* I can see how you might drift into API acceptance testing here, but is it the right tool? Could just be convienience

## Overall

* At the moment, this would be an early win type tool, rather than an established tool for load testing for a build it, run it team
